# TODO List

For The Odin Prject

[Sample preview](https://allieschen.github.io/todolist/)

## Requirements

- Have a _title_, _description_, _dueDate_ and _priority_ as todo-items
- Have _projects_ or separate lists of _todos_

When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of "default" project to which all of their todos are put.

Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

Optional: Have _notes_ and _checklist_ as todo-items

### UI

1. view all projects
2. view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
3. expand a single todo to see/edit its details
4. delete a todo
