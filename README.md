# TODO List

For The Odin Prject

## Requirements

- Have a *title*, *description*, *dueDate* and *priority* as todo-items
- Have *projects* or separate lists of *todos*

When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of "default" project to which all of their todos are put.

Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

Optional: Have *notes* and *checklist* as todo-items

### UI

1. view all projects
2. view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate.. perhaps changing color for different priorities)
3. expand a single todo to see/edit its details
4. delete a todo
